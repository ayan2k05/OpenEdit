# OpenEdit

Welcome to OpenEdit! This is a lightweight, open-source text editor I created to provide a better alternative to heavier editors like Sublime Text,Geany and Visual Studio Code, which consume too many resources on old laptops and computers.

## About Me

My name is **Ayan Pathan**, and I am from **Kota, Rajasthan**. I am currently pursuing a **BTech in AI and Data Science**. You can reach me at: [ayanpathan2511@gmail.com].

## Motivation

I faced significant performance issues with my old laptop(ThinkPad T60P{Restoring}) when using resource-heavy text editors. This experience inspired me to build my own text editor, focusing on simplicity and efficiency.

## Skills Learned

During the development of OpenEdit, I have gained experience in the following areas:

- **Programming Languages**: 
  - Python

- **Frameworks and Libraries**: 
  - Tkinter (for GUI development)
  - os

- **Version Control**: 
  - Git
  - GitHub

- **Open Source Development**: 
  - Contributions in open-source projects
  - Understanding of licensing and community guidelines


## Features

- Lightweight and fast **(0.3% CPU usage, 12MB RAM usage)**
- Graphical user interface
